# Tankoban 2 — Session Bootstrap & State Dashboard

This file auto-loads into every Claude Code session in this directory. The dashboard block is **state** (refreshed by Agent 0 at every phase-boundary commit per Rule 13). Rules and protocols live in `agents/GOVERNANCE.md` — this file does not duplicate them.

## For Claude Sessions — Reading Order

See `agents/GOVERNANCE.md` "Session Start — Reading Order" section. Slimmed 2026-04-16: VERSIONS.md + this file are always-required; everything else is conditional.

This file is **state** (who/what/where right now). `agents/GOVERNANCE.md` is **rules** (how anyone operates). Do not duplicate rules here.

For Codex (Agent 7): see `AGENTS.md` at this same root, which redirects you into the brotherhood's governance.

## Build Quick Reference

- Main app (Release + asset deploy + run): `build_and_run.bat`
- Main app (Debug, MSVC2022 + Qt6.10.2): `build2.bat`
- Sidecar (MinGW, installs to `resources/ffmpeg_sidecar/`): `powershell -File native_sidecar/build.ps1`
- Always: `taskkill //F //IM Tankoban.exe` before any rebuild (Rule 1).
